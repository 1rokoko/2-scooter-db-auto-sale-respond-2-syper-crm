## AI-Driven Motorcycle Marketplace Platform

Completely automated environment that combines WordPress, MySQL, Node.js webhook services, CRM tooling, and AI-driven customer engagement bots.

## Stack Overview
- **WordPress** (6.6) for catalog, CRM panel, and admin workflows
- **MySQL** (8.4) with schema for motorcycles, clients, conversations, deals, and reminders
- **Node.js Webhook** service with OpenAI integration for WhatsApp/Telegram bots
- **Scheduler** worker that polls hot deals
- **Nginx** reverse proxy to expose the stack on `http://localhost:8080`
- **phpMyAdmin** available at `http://localhost:8081`

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Git, Docker, and Docker Compose installed
2. Clone this repository and navigate into it
3. Run `chmod +x install.sh` and execute `./install.sh`
4. The installer provisions dependencies, creates missing assets, spins up containers, seeds the database, and runs automated smoke tests

After the script finishes:
- WordPress: `http://localhost:8080` (admin user from `.env`)
- phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost:8081`
- Webhook API: `http://localhost:8090/webhook`

## Cursor Prompts Library
1. **Generate AI content for motorcycles**
   > Create a WP plugin that registers a custom post type `motorcycle` with meta fields for specs, AI-generated highlights, and photo galleries.
2. **CRM dashboard**
   > Build a WordPress admin page that lists hot deals from `/webhook/deals/hot` and allows managers to mark reminders as sent.
3. **A/B testing flows**
   > Implement a Node webhook endpoint `/webhook/variants` that returns sales copy variations for WhatsApp.

Add these prompts to `docs/api` or `docs/setup` as new features roll out.

## Operational Scripts
- `./stop.sh` gracefully stops all containers
- `./restart.sh` rebuilds and restarts the stack
- `tests/system_healthcheck.sh` is generated by the installer to run smoke tests if missing

## Environment Variables
Edit `.env` to adjust credentials, ports, and OpenAI keys. The installer reads from this file and can regenerate defaults with `--reset-env` (see `install.sh --help`).

## Manual Recovery
If the installer fails:
1. Check `install.log`
2. Run `docker compose ps` to inspect container health
3. Run `docker compose logs <service>` for detailed output
4. Use `docker compose down -v` for a clean slate (this removes volumes)
5. Re-run `./install.sh --force`

Happy building!
